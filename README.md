Entry for ludam dare #28: one color

You are a player (in this case a circle), who can move around the environment based on your color.
The color around your player determines which blocks are walls.

In the first picture, the color around the player is red, so all red blocks are walls.

You can toggle the colors in sucession to move around in the environment.

Here it's green!

Could add on abilities based off of color, and enemies based on color (being able to only see your color, or only fight enemies of your color, etc.
